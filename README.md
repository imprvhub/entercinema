## Installation

### Vue.js Frontend:
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imprvhub/entercinema.git
```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```
3. Before running the project, you need to set up your environment variables in a .env file. Here's how:
```bash
FRONTEND_URL=<Specify the URL where your frontend will be hosted, e.g., 'https://localhost:3000' or your custom domain.>
API_KEY=<Provide your TMDB API key here>
SUPABASE_URL=<Enter the URL for your database, e.g., your Supabase database URL>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<Enter the anonymous key for your database, e.g., your Supabase anonymous key>    
```
  By default, EnterCinema is configured to work with Supabase as the backend DRF database. However, you can use another database if needed. Simply replace DATABASE_URL and DATABASE_ANON_KEY with the appropriate values based on your database configuration.

4. Run the project:
  ```bash
  yarn dev
  ```
  The project should be accesible at, e.g., 'http://localhost:3000'
